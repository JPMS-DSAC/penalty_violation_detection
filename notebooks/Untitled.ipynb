       " 'The total quantity so traded was 347900 shares.',\n",
       " 'A perusal of the aforesaid table indicates that the transactions of KLFL were structured and synchronized.',\n",

       " 'Trades like cross deals reverse transactions circular trades and synchronized trades are all executed on the trading screen of a stock exchange and with proper delivery versus payment system.',\n",

       " 'The buy and the sell orders are placed at almost the same time between the counter brokers with just a difference of a few seconds.',\n",
       " 'This is what has transpired in the present case.',\n",
       " 'Although the matching of these trades has been attributed to coincidence this trend was not noted in a solitary incident or two.',\n",
       " 'Instead a large number of synchronized trades got matched regularly that too only between the same set of brokers and the same set of clients in the same scrip during the same period.',\n",
       " 'The phenomenal regularity with which these clients and their brokers were counterparties leads one to conclude that these transactions were effectively meant to be synchronized.',\n",
       " 'While examining the issue of synchronized trades the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal SAT in Appeal Nos.',\n",
       " '54 to 57 of 2002 in the case of Nirmal Bang Securities P Ltd vs SEBI observed as under “BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global.',\n",

       " 'I find many transactions between BEB and FGSB.',\n",
       " 'There are many instances of such transactions.',\n",
       " 'I find the scrip quantity and price for these orders had been synchronized by the counter party brokers.',\n",
       " 'Such transactions undoubtedly create an artificial market to mislead the genuine investors.',\n",
       " 'Synchronized trading is violative of all prudential and transparent norms of trading in securities.',\n",
       " 'Synchronized trading on a large scale can create false volumes.',\n",
       " 'The argument that the parties had no means of knowing whether any entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading system confidentiality of counter parties is ensured is untenable.',\n",
       " 'It was submitted by the Appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases.',\n",
       " 'Theoretically this is OK.',\n",
       " 'But when parties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different.',\n",
       " 'There are many transactions giving an impression that these were all synchronized otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matching of quantity price etc.',\n",
       " 'As the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a coincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both parties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same quantity of shares almost simultaneously.',\n",
       " 'The data furnished in the show cause notice certainly goes to prove the synchronized nature of the transaction which is in violation of regulation 4 of the FUTP Regulations.',\n",
       " 'The facts on record categorically establish that BEB had indulged in synchronized trading in violation of regulation 47 of the FUTP Regulations.',\n",
       " 'In a synchronized trading intention is implicit.”',\n",
       " 'Keeping in mind the dicta of the SAT as reproduced above I see no reason to take a different view in the present case.',\n",
       " 'I have also noted that during the course of the hearing the AR has confirmed that  MrAmit Kumar Khemka Director of KLFL is also Director on the Boards of ACSY and GSSL.',\n",
       " 'I have also noted that the address of KLFL i.e  8 Ganesh Chandra Avenue Saha Court Kolkata 700 013 is same as that of GSSL.',\n",
       " 'The close association of all the concerned entities in the instant case is not in dispute.',\n",
       " 'The fact is that had the aforesaid discussed trades been executed in the normal course of business the possibility of such perfect matching would not have been possible.',\n",
       " 'The buy and sell prices of one entity were close to the buy sell rates of the other entity in all the settlements such that the trades of these entities were always matched.',\n",
       " 'Eleven purchase and Seventy five sale transactions totaling Eighty Six transactions as pointed out in the table earlier and spread over a period of 7 months are definitely done with some inbuilt component of ‘intent’ involved.',\n",
       " 'Greater the number of synchronized trades the larger is the chances of trades not being genuine in nature which is bound to affect the market equilibrium.',\n",
       " 'A trade can be executed on the screen and still be manipulative in nature.',\n",
       " 'Considering the number of such trades it is clear that there has been a gross misuse of the screen based trading system.',\n",
       " 'Choosing selective time slots does not appear to be an involuntary action.”',\n",
       " 'Thus the very act of manipulation of the scrip of GSSL on the part of KLFL is revealed in their acting in tandem with other entities through their respective brokers which reveals the inherent intention of manipulating the said scrip.',\n",
       " 'I have also considered the fact that clients’ trades of such magnitude are left undone and generally cannot take place without the broker being party to it.',\n",
       " 'It is quite evident that these trades were entered into due to the concerted effort of the concerned brokers i.e  ASBPL and SK which ensured a resemblance of trading activity almost every day during the investigation period.',\n",
       " 'Had the situation contemplated some other set of individuals and had some other clients brokers entered into the trading system of GSSL this would have eroded or nullified the extent of the allegations.',\n",
       " 'These trades as discussed earlier were in the nature of reversal of trades matched deals with the same set of clients on both sides trading through the same set of brokers.',\n",
       " 'The acts of the entities speak of their intentions.',\n",
       " 'In case an entity is alleged to have manipulated the market or distorted the market equilibrium in terms of the PFUTP and their acts are corroborated up to a certain extent by the investigation findings then the underlying intention of the said entity is brought out.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore price manipulation does not only involve only manipulation in the prices of the scrip but also includes building up of volumes.',\n",
       " 'This is evident from the finding that KLFL had traded 347900 shares all being structured and synchronized deals which is part of the 7062710 shares transacted by ASBPL and SK representing around 62% of the gross traded quantity during the entire period of investigation in CSE.',\n",
       " 'The Hon’ble SAT in Ketan Parekh Vs.',\n",
       " 'As already observed ‘synchronisation’ or a negotiated deal ipso facto is not illegal.',\n",
       " 'Any transaction executed with the intention to defeat the market mechanism whether negotiated or not would be illegal.',\n",
       " 'Whether a transaction has been executed with the intention to manipulate the market or defeat its mechanism will depend upon the intention of the parties which could be inferred from the attending circumstances because direct evidence in such cases may not be available.',\n",
       " 'This list of factors in the very nature of things cannot be exhaustive.',\n",
       " 'Any one factor may or may not be decisive and it is from the cumulative effect of these that an inference will have to be drawn.”',\n",
       " 'By way of generating artificial volumes KLFL created a false impression amongst the general investors as regards the trading activity in the scrip of GSSL which is otherwise illiquid and thus tried to induce the general public to deal in those securities.',\n",
       " 'As violation of the above cited provisions of PFUTP has been established I hold that the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under section 15HA of SEBI Act which reads as under  15HA.Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.',\n",
       " 'If any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities he shall be liable to a penalty of twentyfive crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices whichever is higher.',\n",
       " 'While determining the quantum of penalty under section 15A b it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under 30.',\n",
       " 'It is difficult in cases of such nature to quantify the disproportionate gains or unfair advantage enjoyed by an entity and the consequent losses suffered by the investors.',\n",
       " 'I have noted that the investigation report also does not dwell on the extent of specific gains made by KLFL.',\n",
       " 'In fact liquidity volumes in particular scrip raise the issue of ‘demand’ in the securities market.',\n",
       " 'The greater the liquidity the higher is the investors’ attraction towards investing in that scrip.',\n",
       " 'Hence anyone could have been carried away by the unusual fluctuations in the volumes and been induced into investing in the said scrip.',\n",
       " 'Besides this kind of activity seriously affects the normal price discovery mechanism of the securities market.',\n",
       " 'People who indulge in manipulative fraudulent and deceptive transactions or abet the carrying out of such transactions which are fraudulent and deceptive should be suitably penalized for the said acts of omissions and commissions.',\n",
       " 'Considering the continuous effort of KLFL in this aspect where the synchronized trades were carried out over a period from April 2005 to November 2005 it can safely be surmised that the nature of default was repetitive.',\n",
       " 'After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs 1 00000  Rupees One Lakh Only on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the violation committed by it.',\n",
